We named our group CodeVengers because we had same goal of bringing a change in future by using technology.Technology is what brings us together.          We decided to team up because it teaches us may soft skills like teamwork, delegation of tasks and meeting deadlines. Working in a team has taught us to seek each other's advice, respect each other's opinions and take a collective decision keeping in mind what would be best for our project.</p>
